    <string name="question1Title">What does each color mean?</string>
    <string name="question1Content">Green = Note Completed\nBlue = Note Planned (you haven\'t done it yet but you still haven\'t reach your deadline)\nRed = Note Expired (the due date is passed but you haven\'t completed the task)</string>
    <string name="question2Title">What does a note contains?</string>
    <string name="question2Content">Text details: you can assign a title, a description and some other more specific attributes useful for organizing your tasks (e.g. tags, grade of importance etc)\nAlarm: you can choose to turn it on to receive a reminder notification at the time set\n Sub activities: need to go grocery shopping? We got you covered!\n Attachments: too busy to write down a note in every detail? Just snap a photo or record an audio message related to the task. Quick and easy!</string>
    <string name="question3Title">I have accidentally deleted from the gallery an image used in a note…</string>
    <string name="question3Content">Don\'t worry, 321DO! saves it\'s own copy of the image so you can safely delete the original file to free space (this doesn\'t applies to audios).</string>
    <string name="question4Title">Can I recover a deleted note? What about a deleted attachment?</string>
    <string name="question4Content">No, you cannot recover a deleted note, you have however a limited time to cancel the delete operation immediately after (a quick UNDO option should appear on the bottom of the screen).\nWhen you delete a note, every attachment is also deleted (otherwise it will occupy memory in vain); audio messages in particular are not recoverable (for images see previous question).</string>
    <string name="question5Title">Making a note is quick, but I want to be quicker!</string>
    <string name="question5Content">You can, just add the 321DO! widget to your home!</string>
    <string name="question6Title">How does reminders works?</string>
    <string name="question6Content">1. You set a date and a time from the edit options\n2. When the given time comes you will receive a notification\n3. The notification will give you three options, complete the task, dimiss the task (that will then be considered expired) and snooze the alarm.\n The expanded notification will also show you all the details regarding the pending task.\n4. If you choose to snooze the notification you will have to pick a costum amount of time and the alarm will be represented to you later</string>
    <string name="question7Title">How does tags/categories works?</string>
    <string name="question7Content">You can assign a tag to each note to organize them by your needs.\n By default there aren\'t any tag, a tag is created every time the user assign a new one to a note.\nExisting tags will be suggested during the editing of the notes.\n You can also use the search bar to find notes that contains a given tag.</string>
    <string name="question8Title">What happens when I clone a note?</string>
    <string name="question8Content">A new note is created and every textual information is copied from the original note, the other fields are set to default values.\n Attachments are not copied to preserve memory, due dates and alarms neither because you are probably going to set a new one right?</string>
    <string name="question9Title">You said default values, what does that mean?</string>
    <string name="question9Content">When you create a note you probably won\'t have time to choose each detail so 321DO! covers you by filling the following field with the following values:\n Title - Current time\n Due Date - Tomorrow morning\n Priority and Urgency - Normal\n Attachments - None\n Every other field is left blank.</string>
    <string name="creditsTitle">Credits</string>
    <string name="creditsContent">321DO! is an app created entirely by me, Luca Alessio: I\'m a bachelor student in Computer Science at University of Padua and I\'ve worked on this application during my stage period at Ceremit srl.\nI\'ve found a bit hard to enter in the world of Android Development so I intend to share what I\'ve learned with other students and enthusiasts: you can find the source code (in all it\'s glory and bad practices) here:\nhttps://github.com/lalessio/321do</string>
